# ML-project
This is the work that I put into our Machine Learning course project at the end of the term. This project is to predict liver failure with the help of given demographics in the dataset.
This dataset called Acute Liver Failure (ALF) is a xlsx datasheet consisting of demographic and health information of Indian adults. It is produced by the JPAC Center of Health Diagnosis and Control and has input values collected through various primary methods. The link to the data set is: https://www.kaggle.com/rahul121/acute-liver-failure
The most optimal Machine Learning method for medical data is the Support Vector Machine has been implemented to analyze and predict risk areas from this dataset.
